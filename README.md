# 0 - About Project

This Project intend to make ADE9000 work with ESP32 platform (esp-idf)

# 1 - About ADE9000

The ADE9000 is a highly accurate, fully integrated, multiphase energy and power quality monitoring device. Superior analog performance and a digital signal processing (DSP) core enable accurate energy monitoring over a wide dynamic range. An integrated high end reference ensures low drift over temperature with a combined drift of less than ±25 ppm/°C maximum for the entire channel including a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC).
